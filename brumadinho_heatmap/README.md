# Brumadinho Heatmap Location
This maps plots s GeoJSON file in a heatmap Layer. The map that I use is MapBox.


# To Do
1- The next step is get the places that were visited from the Brumadinho API, I'm just waiting for the response of the API's developer
2- Make an option to just plot the map of a specific day - save everyday a GeoJSON File of the areas that were visited in the day, and make an option Dropdown - FOR THE FUTURE
